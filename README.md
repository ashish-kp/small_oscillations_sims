# small_oscillations_sims

Here, there are the codes for certain very simplistic and ideal physical systems, which I encountered while learning about Small Oscillations. 
Hopefully, I'll write their E.O.Ms here, just for better understandability.

So, the systems are:
- Two balls attached by a spring. (Let the first ball have a mass m1 and the second ball have a mass m2, and their position co-ordinates be x_1 and x_2)

![\ddot{x} = \dfrac{k}{m_1} (x_1 - x_2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})
