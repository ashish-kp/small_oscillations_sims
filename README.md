# small_oscillations_sims

Here, there are the codes for certain very simplistic and ideal physical systems, which I encountered while learning about Small Oscillations. 
Hopefully, I'll write their E.O.Ms here, just for better understandability.

So, the systems are:
- Two balls attached by a spring. (Let the first ball have a mass m1 and the second ball have a mass m2, and their position co-ordinates be x_1 and x_2)

![x_1ddoteqn](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\ddot{x}_1=-\dfrac{k}{m_1}((x_1&space;-&space;x_{01})&space;-&space;(x_2-x_{02})))
