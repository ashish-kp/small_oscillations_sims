# small_oscillations_sims

Here, there are the codes for certain very simplistic and ideal physical systems, which I encountered while learning about Small Oscillations. 
Hopefully, I'll write their E.O.Ms here, just for better understandability.

So, the systems are:
1. Two balls attached by a spring. (Let the first ball have a mass m1 and the second ball have a mass m2, and their position co-ordinates be x_1 and x_2, and let the spring have a spring constant k)

- ![x_2ddoteqn](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\ddot{x}_2=\dfrac{-k}{m_1}((x_2&space;-&space;x_{02})&space;-&space;(x_1-x_{01})))

2. Three balls attached by
